The genuine WmiPrvSE.exe file is a software component of Microsoft Windows Management Instrumentation by Microsoft Corporation."WmiPrvSE.exe" is Microsoft's Provider Host Service for Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). It resides in the "WBEM" subdirectory of "C:\Windows\System32". It is a core Windows system file and cannot be uninstalled. Multiple instances of it can run at a time, each being a "host" implementing a WMI "provider" routine. Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) is a standard by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) which is implemented in Windows as WMI, (a set of extensions to the Windows Driver Model), so that Windows servers and workstations can belong to enterprise networks which use remote infrastructure monitoring and control applications conforming to WBEM and the Common Information Model (CIM). A WMI "provider" routine collects and transmits information to the monitoring application about performance of a process or subsystem. If this name exists outside "C:\Windows\System32\WBEM", it is probably disguised malware. Microsoft is a multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, WA, USA.
