Process: conhost.exe
Count: 3

The genuine conhost.exe file is a software component of Microsoft Windows/Microsoft Server by Microsoft Corporation.At least two "conhost.exe" programs exist, one an essential Microsoft Windows system process and one a Trojan. The Microsoft Console Host program resides in "C:\Windows\System32" and should not be removed. It was created for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 to thwart malware exploitation. In WinXP, "console applications" without GUI's, run with parameters from the command prompt, used a kernel call to send messages to "CSRSS.exe" for processing. "CSRSS.exe" has local system account privileges, which some malware exploited. "Conhost.exe" is a step before "CSRSS.exe" which has only the application's privileges and frustrates such exploits. The older Trojan "conhost.exe" predates Microsoft's. It is a crypto-currency miner, in a temporary folder, using up to 100% of the CPU to find Bitcoin or Monero crypto-currency units on other computers and send them elsewhere. It may mean the dangerous TDSS botnet virus is present, which Kaspersky's free tool removes.

Process: spoolsv.exe
Count: 1

The genuine spoolsv.exe file is a software component of Microsoft Windows Operating System by Microsoft.Spoolsv.exe is an executable file that runs the Print Spooler Service, a process that caches printing jobs into system memory as images as printers cannot understand fonts or decipher graphics. This process sometimes takes a huge amount of system resources as processing different file formats into an image suitable for printing often takes time and a lot of memory. To clear this memory and stop the process, simply right click on the printer icon in the Taskbar and select, 'Exit'. This is a core Windows process so disabling it from the Task Manager may result in a critical failure causing the system to automatically reboot. Microsoft was founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen and quickly rose to prominence following the launch of their popular operating system, MS-DOS, for early personally computers. Microsoft began developing graphical user interface and the distinguishable Start-button on the introduction on Windows 95. Further additions like networking and security soon followed.

Process: w3wp.exe
Count: 1

The genuine w3wp.exe file is a software component of Internet Information Services by Microsoft Corporation.If "w3wp.exe" is present on a system and is located in "C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv", then it is the "worker process" within Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS) web server. In any other location, including "\System32" or any other subfolder of it, "w3wp.exe" is probably disguised malware. IIS is one of the world's three most popular web servers (besides Apache HTTP Server and Nginx) for hosting web sites and handling requests received via HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and other protocols. One or more "worker processes" can run at the same time under the Windows Process Activation Service (WAS) within IIS, each representing an "application pool." The concept can be compared to the way Windows uses one or more concurrent instances of "svchost.exe" under Task Manager to represent a variety of different Windows services. Microsoft Corporation, founded in 1975 by Paul Allen and Bill Gates, is headquartered in Redmond, WA, USA.

Process: wmiprvse.exe
Count: 2

The genuine WmiPrvSE.exe file is a software component of Microsoft Windows Management Instrumentation by Microsoft Corporation."WmiPrvSE.exe" is Microsoft's Provider Host Service for Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). It resides in the "WBEM" subdirectory of "C:\Windows\System32". It is a core Windows system file and cannot be uninstalled. Multiple instances of it can run at a time, each being a "host" implementing a WMI "provider" routine. Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) is a standard by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) which is implemented in Windows as WMI, (a set of extensions to the Windows Driver Model), so that Windows servers and workstations can belong to enterprise networks which use remote infrastructure monitoring and control applications conforming to WBEM and the Common Information Model (CIM). A WMI "provider" routine collects and transmits information to the monitoring application about performance of a process or subsystem. If this name exists outside "C:\Windows\System32\WBEM", it is probably disguised malware. Microsoft is a multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, WA, USA.
