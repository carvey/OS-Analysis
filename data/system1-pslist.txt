Process: system.exe
Count: 1

The genuine system.exe file is a software component of Malware.Microsoft Windows does not have an executable file named "system.exe", but there are numerous unwanted or malicious programs using that name, one of which may become installed in "C:\Windows\System32" and therefore show a "Command Line" field in Task Manager saying, "C:\Windows\System32\system.exe". When Windows is running there is a valid System process in Task Manager but its "Command Line" field is blank because what is running are system threads handling network i/o, disk i/o, and the actual kernel itself. Some malware using the "system.exe" name may have false internal data attributing itself to Microsoft, even saying "Microsoft Windows Operating System". Be careful about deleting a "system.exe" file which appears in a legitimate third-party application's subfolder tree, but in "C:\Windows" no such file should exist. Microsoft Corporation in Redmond, Washington, USA, is a multinational technology company founded April 4, 1975 by Paul Allen and Bill Gates.

Process: lsass.exe
Count: 1

The genuine lsass.exe file is a software component of Microsoft Windows by Microsoft Corporation.If "lsass.exe" resides in "C:\Windows\System32", it is the Microsoft Windows Operating System's Local Security Authority Subsystem Service. Six critical Windows services involved in the computer's security management are dynamic link library (.dll) files which are called by "lsass.exe". These include "vaultsvc.dll", which controls access to credentials of users and applications; "efssvc.dll", central to storage of encrypted files on NTFS-type disk volumes; and "samsrv.dll", the Security Accounts Manager. If the real "lsass.exe" is forcibly stopped the machine is forced into a restart because the Welcome screen loses its account(s). It also cannot be uninstalled. In other locations, assume "lsass.exe" is disguised malware, which may include extremely dangerous Trojans or worms. A spyware or malware removal program may be needed to remove such files.

Under Windows 8, (and later), this is the name for the module which presents a menu to select "Graphics Properties," which starts another module presenting a window to adjust color calibration and other graphics settings. (Before Windows 8, "igfxsrvc.exe" was used.) It should not be uninstalled except to install updated Intel® graphics drivers. Get driver updates from the OEM's website because they may be customized; Intel's are generic. Replacing a display's default color calibration profile with one generated by a third-party app may cause reversion to old values when waking from hibernation. Using Task Manager before hibernation to end "igfxCUIService.exe" prevents this, only until the next restart. (Consult Microsoft Support.)

Process: spoolsv.exe
Count: 1

The genuine spoolsv.exe file is a software component of Microsoft Windows Operating System by Microsoft.Spoolsv.exe is an executable file that runs the Print Spooler Service, a process that caches printing jobs into system memory as images as printers cannot understand fonts or decipher graphics. This process sometimes takes a huge amount of system resources as processing different file formats into an image suitable for printing often takes time and a lot of memory. To clear this memory and stop the process, simply right click on the printer icon in the Taskbar and select, 'Exit'. This is a core Windows process so disabling it from the Task Manager may result in a critical failure causing the system to automatically reboot. Microsoft was founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen and quickly rose to prominence following the launch of their popular operating system, MS-DOS, for early personally computers. Microsoft began developing graphical user interface and the distinguishable Start-button on the introduction on Windows 95. Further additions like networking and security soon followed.
