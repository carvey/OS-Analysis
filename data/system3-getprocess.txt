PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS


Process: system.exe
Count: 1

The genuine system.exe file is a software component of Malware.Microsoft Windows does not have an executable file named "system.exe", but there are numerous unwanted or malicious programs using that name, one of which may become installed in "C:\Windows\System32" and therefore show a "Command Line" field in Task Manager saying, "C:\Windows\System32\system.exe". When Windows is running there is a valid System process in Task Manager but its "Command Line" field is blank because what is running are system threads handling network i/o, disk i/o, and the actual kernel itself. Some malware using the "system.exe" name may have false internal data attributing itself to Microsoft, even saying "Microsoft Windows Operating System". Be careful about deleting a "system.exe" file which appears in a legitimate third-party application's subfolder tree, but in "C:\Windows" no such file should exist. Microsoft Corporation in Redmond, Washington, USA, is a multinational technology company founded April 4, 1975 by Paul Allen and Bill Gates.

Count: 1

The genuine spoolsv.exe file is a software component of Microsoft Windows Operating System by Microsoft.Spoolsv.exe is an executable file that runs the Print Spooler Service, a process that caches printing jobs into system memory as images as printers cannot understand fonts or decipher graphics. This process sometimes takes a huge amount of system resources as processing different file formats into an image suitable for printing often takes time and a lot of memory. To clear this memory and stop the process, simply right click on the printer icon in the Taskbar and select, 'Exit'. This is a core Windows process so disabling it from the Task Manager may result in a critical failure causing the system to automatically reboot. Microsoft was founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen and quickly rose to prominence following the launch of their popular operating system, MS-DOS, for early personally computers. Microsoft began developing graphical user interface and the distinguishable Start-button on the introduction on Windows 95. Further additions like networking and security soon followed.

Process: wmiprvse.exe
Count: 3

The genuine WmiPrvSE.exe file is a software component of Microsoft Windows Management Instrumentation by Microsoft Corporation."WmiPrvSE.exe" is Microsoft's Provider Host Service for Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). It resides in the "WBEM" subdirectory of "C:\Windows\System32". It is a core Windows system file and cannot be uninstalled. Multiple instances of it can run at a time, each being a "host" implementing a WMI "provider" routine. Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) is a standard by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) which is implemented in Windows as WMI, (a set of extensions to the Windows Driver Model), so that Windows servers and workstations can belong to enterprise networks which use remote infrastructure monitoring and control applications conforming to WBEM and the Common Information Model (CIM). A WMI "provider" routine collects and transmits information to the monitoring application about performance of a process or subsystem. If this name exists outside "C:\Windows\System32\WBEM", it is probably disguised malware. Microsoft is a multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, WA, USA.

WMIPrvSe stands for Windows Management Instrumentation Provider Host Service



Windows® Management Instrumentation (WMI) is a component of the Microsoft® Windows® operating system that provides management information and control in an enterprise environment.
By using industry standards, managers can use WMI to query and set information on desktop systems, applications, networks and other enterprise components.
Developers can use WMI to create event monitoring applications that alert users when important incidents occur.
 
In earlier versions of Windows, providers were loaded in-process with the Windows Management service (WinMgmt.exe), running under the LocalSystem security account. Failure of a provider caused the entire WMI service to fail; the next request to WMI restarted the service.

Beginning with Windows XP, WMI resides in a shared service host with several other services. To avoid stopping all the services when a provider fails, providers are loaded into a separate host process named Wmiprvse.exe. Multiple instances of Wmiprvse.exe can run at the same time under different accounts: LocalSystem, NetworkService or LocalService. The WMI core WinMgmt.exe is loaded into the shared Local Service host named Svchost.exe.

Note: wmiprvsw.exe is the Sasser worm!

For example, Windows Defender and Windows Update use a service that is hosted by a svchost.exe process. The file often connects to www.windowsupdate.microsoft.com by either visiting the Microsoft Update website, Microsoft Windows Update website, or through automatic updating without a browser. "svchost.exe" is the host processor that manages the group of update service DLLs in the database from the Windows User Automatic Updates Server (WUAUSERV) by way of IP management and port protocol. Microsoft, known for their leading worldwide operating systems, provides global solutions for home and business audiences through innovative programming, product developments, software applications, and networking processes.

SvcHost stands for Service Host



"Svchost.exe" (Generic Host Process for Win32 Services) is an integral part of Windows OS. It cannot be stopped or restarted manually.
This process manages system services that run from dynamic link libraries (files with extension .dll).
Examples for such system services are: "Automatic Updates", "Windows Firewall", "Plug and Play", "Fax Service", "Windows Themes" and many more.
 
At startup, Svchost.exe checks the services portion of the registry and constructs a list of services that it needs to load.
Under normal conditions, multiple instances of Svchost.exe will be running simultaneously. Each Svchost.exe session can contain a grouping of services,
so that many services can be run depending on how and where Svchost.exe is started. This allows for better control and debugging.

If the process svchost.exe uses high cpu resources, it is mostly due because the service "Automatic Updates" is downloading some new Windows update.
But having a 99% or 100% cpu usage could be caused by downloads due of some hidden malware on your computer.
Some malware like the Conficker worm changes the Windows Registry so that svchost loads the malware .dll file. In this case you only see the authentic svchost.exe process in the task manager!
Use our free Svchost Analyzer to find such malware.
