Process: conhost.exe
Count: 1

The genuine conhost.exe file is a software component of Microsoft Windows/Microsoft Server by Microsoft Corporation.At least two "conhost.exe" programs exist, one an essential Microsoft Windows system process and one a Trojan. The Microsoft Console Host program resides in "C:\Windows\System32" and should not be removed. It was created for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 to thwart malware exploitation. In WinXP, "console applications" without GUI's, run with parameters from the command prompt, used a kernel call to send messages to "CSRSS.exe" for processing. "CSRSS.exe" has local system account privileges, which some malware exploited. "Conhost.exe" is a step before "CSRSS.exe" which has only the application's privileges and frustrates such exploits. The older Trojan "conhost.exe" predates Microsoft's. It is a crypto-currency miner, in a temporary folder, using up to 100% of the CPU to find Bitcoin or Monero crypto-currency units on other computers and send them elsewhere. It may mean the dangerous TDSS botnet virus is present, which Kaspersky's free tool removes.

The genuine spoolsv.exe file is a software component of Microsoft Windows Operating System by Microsoft.Spoolsv.exe is an executable file that runs the Print Spooler Service, a process that caches printing jobs into system memory as images as printers cannot understand fonts or decipher graphics. This process sometimes takes a huge amount of system resources as processing different file formats into an image suitable for printing often takes time and a lot of memory. To clear this memory and stop the process, simply right click on the printer icon in the Taskbar and select, 'Exit'. This is a core Windows process so disabling it from the Task Manager may result in a critical failure causing the system to automatically reboot. Microsoft was founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen and quickly rose to prominence following the launch of their popular operating system, MS-DOS, for early personally computers. Microsoft began developing graphical user interface and the distinguishable Start-button on the introduction on Windows 95. Further additions like networking and security soon followed.
